# Wine Quality Analysis
### With Testing & Reproducibility

## Project Goal

This project is focused on practicing the core fundamentals of data analysis using Python and Pandas. Using a real, publicly available dataset, the goal is to work through the full basic workflow a Data Scientist would follow: 
- Loading raw data into a DataFrame
- Inspecting it to understand its structure and quality (data types, missing values, duplicates)
- Filtering and grouping it to answer specific questions about the data
- Training a simple machine learning model to see how well a few variables can predict an outcome
- Visualizing the results through different types of charts. 

The emphasis throughout is on understanding *why* each step matters, not just running the code.

This phase of the project builds on that original analysis by focusing on making it **reproducible and reliable**: the analysis logic was refactored into individually testable functions, a suite of unit and system tests was added to verify each step works correctly, and a GitHub Actions workflow now runs those tests automatically on every push.

You can run it through pandas via the `"analysis.py"` file. Pandas is the widely-supported default with the biggest ecosystem.

Or you can run it through polars via the `"analysis_polars.py"` file. Polars are used when speed and memory efficiency is the priority for larger sets of data.

## The Dataset

**Wine Quality (Red and White)**, sourced from Kaggle:

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/amirmohamadrezaie/red-and-white-wine-quality

The file `data/wine_quality_merged.csv` contains both red and white wine samples
combined into a single file, with a `type` column that already labels each row as
`"red"` or `"white"`. Each row is one wine sample, described by 11 chemical
measurements, plus a `quality` score from 0–10 assigned by wine tasters. 
The columns are:

`fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, chlorides, free sulfur
dioxide, total sulfur dioxide, density, pH, sulphates, alcohol, quality, type`

## How to run this

These steps assume you've already cloned this repository and have a terminal open inside the `wine-quality-analysis` folder.

### 1. Create a virtual environment

Run this in the **terminal**:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
```

This creates a folder called `.venv` that holds a clean, isolated copy of Python just for this project, so the packages you install don't clash with anything else on your machine.

### 2. Activate the virtual environment

Run this in the **terminal**:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

You'll know it worked because your terminal prompt will now show `(.venv)` at the start of the line. You need to run this activation command every time you open a new terminal window to work on this project.

### 3. Install the required packages

Run this in the **terminal** (with the virtual environment still active):

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This reads the `requirements.txt` file in this repo and installs the libraries both scripts need: `pandas`, `polars`, `pyarrow`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `scikit-learn`.

### 4. Add the dataset

This is a **file/folder step, not a terminal command**: 
Make sure `wine_quality_merged.csv` is placed inside a folder named `data/`, sitting right next to `analysis.py`. The folder structure should look like this:

```
wine-quality-analysis/
├── analysis.py
├── analysis_polars.py
├── data/
│   └── wine_quality_merged.csv
├── graphs/
├── requirements.txt
├── Makefile
└── README.md
```

If you don't have the dataset yet, download it from the Kaggle link in the "Dataset" section above and place it in the `data/` folder.

### 5. Run the script

Run this in the **terminal**:

```bash
python analysis.py
```

This runs every step of `analysis.py` from top to bottom: it loads the dataset, prints inspection details, prints the filtering and grouping results, trains the model and prints its performance, and finally saves two charts.

There's also `analysis_polars.py`, which does the exact same analysis and produces the same
results using [Polars](https://pola.rs/) instead of Pandas, plus a Pandas-vs-Polars speed
benchmark as a final step (see the [Pandas vs Polars Benchmark](#pandas-vs-polars-benchmark)
section below). Run it the same way:

```bash
python analysis_polars.py
```

### 6. Check the output

You don't need to run anything for this step. Just look at what happened:

- All the printed results (row counts, `.describe()` output, filter counts, group tables, model error and R-squared) appear directly in your **terminal**.
- `analysis.py` creates two image **files** inside the `graphs/` folder: `graphs/quality_vs_alcohol.png` and `graphs/alcohol_vs_density.png`. `analysis_polars.py` creates the Polars equivalents (`graphs/quality_vs_alcohol_polars.png`, `graphs/alcohol_vs_density_polars.png`) plus `graphs/pandas_vs_polars_benchmark.png`. Open these from VS Code's file explorer (or any image viewer) to see the charts.

### Optional: using the Makefile shortcuts

If you'd rather not type each command separately, this repo includes a `Makefile` with shortcuts. These also run in the **terminal**:

- `make setup` - creates the virtual environment and installs the requirements (does steps 1–3 for you)
- `make run` - runs `analysis.py` (does step 5 for you)
- `make run-polars` - runs `analysis_polars.py`, the Polars version plus the benchmark
- `make clean` - deletes the generated charts and cached Python files, useful if you want a fresh run

## Testing & CI

This project includes a suite of unit and system tests in `test_wine_analysis.py`, covering data loading, preprocessing/filtering, grouping, model training and evaluation, and chart generation, plus one end-to-end test that runs the full pipeline.

Run the tests with:

```bash
pytest -v
```

Every push to this repository also automatically runs these tests via GitHub Actions (see the badge at the top of this README).

## Step-by-step walkthrough

### Step 1: Importing the dataset

**What this step does:** 

Loads the single merged CSV file into a pandas DataFrame (a table) and takes a first look at how the two wine types are represented in it.

```python
wine = pd.read_csv("data/wine_quality_merged.csv")
print(f"Total rows: {len(wine)}")
print(wine["type"].value_counts())
```

**What we found:** 

*The dataset has 6,497 wines total.*
*4,898 white (about 75%) and 1,599 red (about 25%), so white wines make up the large majority of the combined file.*

---

### Step 2: Inspecting the Data

**What this step does:** 

Looks at the data's structure and health before doing any
real analysis. Its shape, what the columns look like, what type of data each holds, and
whether anything is missing or duplicated.

```python
print(f"Shape (rows, columns): {wine.shape}")
print(wine.head())
wine.info()
print(wine.describe())
print("Missing values:")
print(wine.isnull().sum())
print(f"Duplicate rows: {wine.duplicated().sum()}")
```

**What we found:** 

*`wine.shape` confirms the dataset is 6,497 rows by 13 columns.*
*No column has any missing values. Every one of the 13 columns shows 0 missing across all 6,497 rows.*
*There are, however, 1,177 exact duplicate rows (about 18% of the dataset), rows that repeat another row's values identically.* 
*.describe() shows that most chemical measurements are fairly tight (e.g. alcohol ranges from 8.0% to 14.9%, averaging 10.49%), but residual sugar is heavily skewed: its 75th percentile is 8.1 but its maximum is 65.8, meaning a small number of unusually sweet wines pull the average up.*

---

### Step 3: Filtering

**What this step does:** 

Pulls out five different meaningful subsets of the data,
using `.query()` to write each condition as plain text. This shows filtering on a
single numeric range, a combined range, and combined conditions across two columns
(type *and* alcohol) at once.

```python
high_quality = wine.query("quality >= 7")
bad_quality = wine.query("quality <= 4")
medium_quality = wine.query("quality > 4 and quality < 7")
high_alcohol_red = wine.query("type == 'red' and alcohol > 12")
low_alcohol_red = wine.query("type == 'red' and alcohol < 10")
```

**What we found:** 

If we consider alcohol quality, out of 6,497 wines: 
- 1,277 (about 20%) are high quality (score ≥ 7)
- 246 (about 4%) are bad quality (score ≤ 4)
- the remaining 4,974 (about 77%) fall in the medium range
*So most wines cluster around average quality, and truly bad wines are rare.* 

Secondly, among red wines specifically:
- 141 (about 9% of all reds) have alcohol above 12%
- 680 (about 43% of all reds) have alcohol below 10%
*Therefore, lower-alcohol reds are considerably more common than higher-alcohol ones.*

---

### Step 4: Grouping

**What this step does:** 

Splits the dataset into groups and computes summary
statistics for each group. First by wine type, and then by quality score.

```python
by_type = wine.groupby("type").agg(
    avg_alcohol=("alcohol", "mean"),
    avg_quality=("quality", "mean"),
    no_of_wines=("quality", "count"),
)

by_quality = wine.groupby("quality").agg(
    avg_alcohol=("alcohol", "mean"),
    no_of_wines=("alcohol", "count"),
)
```

**What we found:** 

*White wines average a slightly higher quality score than red (5.88 vs. 5.64) despite very similar average alcohol content (10.51% vs. 10.42%).*
*White also shows more variation in alcohol (std 1.23 vs. 1.07).* 
*The alcohol-by-quality relationship isn't perfectly straight-line: quality scores 3 and 4 actually have slightly higher average alcohol (10.2%) than quality 5 (9.8%, the lowest point in the table), but from quality 5 upward the trend climbs steadily and clearly:* 
*9.8% → 10.6% → 11.4% → 11.7% → 12.2% across quality 5 through 9. Overall, higher-quality wines do tend to have more alcohol, especially in the upper half of the range.*

---

### Step 5: Machine Learning model

**What this step does:** 

Trains a Linear Regression model, the simplest predictive
model there is. To predict a wine's quality score from three of its chemical
properties, then measures how good its predictions were on data it never saw during
training.

```python
features = ["alcohol", "volatile acidity", "sulphates"]
X = wine[features]
y = wine["quality"]

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42
)

model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
predictions = model.predict(X_test)

mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, predictions)
r2 = r2_score(y_test, predictions)
```

Each feature's learned coefficient is then printed with a loop:
```python
for feature, coef in zip(features, model.coef_):
    print(f"{feature}: {coef:.3f}")
```
`model.coef_` holds one number per feature, in the same order as `features`; `zip()`
pairs each feature name with its coefficient so the loop can print both together. A
positive coefficient means "as this feature goes up, predicted quality tends to go up
too"; negative means the opposite.

**What we found:** 

*The model's Mean Squared Error was 0.551 and R-squared was 0.253*

*These three features (alcohol, volatile acidity, sulphates) explain about 25% of the variation in quality, a real but modest amount, since quality clearly depends on more than three chemical measurements.* 

- *Volatile acidity had by far the strongest effect (coefficient −1.466): as it increases, predicted quality drops sharply, consistent with volatile acidity being linked to a vinegar-like taste.* 
- *Sulphates (+0.641) and alcohol (+0.322) both had smaller, positive effects. More of either tends to predict slightly higher quality.*

---

### Step 6: Visualization - Boxplot

**What this step does:** 

Draws a boxplot comparing alcohol content across quality scores, split by wine type.

```python
sns.boxplot(data=wine, x="quality", y="alcohol", hue="type")
```

**Why alcohol and quality:** 

Alcohol is one of the three features the model above uses
to predict quality, so this chart lets you *see* that relationship directly instead of
just reading a coefficient. `hue="type"` adds a second comparison for free - red vs. white - on the same chart.

**Why a boxplot?** 

`quality` only takes a handful of whole-number values (3-9), so it behaves like a category rather than a continuous number. A boxplot is built for exactly that: it groups the continuous variable (alcohol) by each discrete category (quality score) and shows the median, spread, and outliers for every group side by side, which a scatter plot can't do cleanly with so few x-values.

**What we found:** 

*The boxplot's pattern matches the by_quality numbers above: alcohol content generally climbs as quality score increases, most clearly from quality 5 onward, and the trend looks broadly similar for red and white, though white's boxes show a bit more spread at the low end.*

![Alcohol Content by Wine Quality Score](graphs/quality_vs_alcohol.png)

---

### Step 7: Visualization - Scatter Plot

**What this step does:** 

Adds a second chart, this time comparing two continuous
chemical properties directly against each other rather than against the discrete
quality score.

```python
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
sns.regplot(data=wine, x="alcohol", y="density", scatter_kws={"alpha": 0.3}, line_kws={"color": "red"})
plt.title("Alcohol Content vs. Density (All Wines)")
plt.xlabel("Alcohol (%)")
plt.ylabel("Density")
plt.tight_layout()
plt.savefig("graphs/alcohol_vs_density.png", dpi=150)
print("Scatter plot with trend line saved as alcohol_vs_density.png")
```

**Why alcohol and density (and not quality again):** 

Alcohol and density are both continuous measurements, and wine
chemistry gives a real reason to expect a relationship between them: alcohol is less
dense than water, so wines with more alcohol tend to have lower density. This version
also combines red and white into one group rather than splitting by `hue="type"`, to
show the overall trend across every wine at once.

**Why a scatter plot?** 

`quality` only takes whole numbers from 3 to 9, so a scatter plot with `quality` on an axis produces vertical
stripes of points rather than a smooth cloud. A boxplot (Step 6) is the better tool
for that comparison. Alcohol and density, on the other hand, are both continuous, so
plotting one against the other produces a smooth cloud of points rather than stripes -
making this pair a clearer, more classic example of what a scatter plot is for.

**What we found:** 

*The scatter plot shows a clear inverse relationship.*
*As alcohol content goes up, density tends to go down. The red trend line slopes downward across the whole range, confirming this. Most points are tightly packed in a diagonal band between about 8–14% alcohol and a density of 0.99–1.00, which makes sense chemically: alcohol is less dense than water, so wines with more alcohol are naturally less dense.*
*There are a few outliers worth noting though. One wine near 11.5% alcohol has an unusually high density (about 1.04), and one near 8.8% alcohol sits at about 1.01, both well above the rest of the cloud. Aside from those outliers, the relationship is fairly consistent and fits a straight line reasonably well, though the points do fan out a bit more at the lower end of alcohol content than at the higher end.* 

*Check out alcohol_vs_density yourself below and confirm.*

![Alcohol Content vs. Density (All Wines)](graphs/alcohol_vs_density.png)

---

## Overall Findings

*Across the dataset, white wines slightly outperform red on average quality (5.88 vs. 5.64), despite nearly identical average alcohol.* 
*Alcohol content is genuinely useful for predicting quality, visible both in the by_quality trend and in the regression model.*
*However, volatile acidity matters more, and in the opposite direction: it's the strongest single predictor of lower quality among the three features tested. The 3-feature linear model captures a real signal (R² = 0.253) but is far from complete, which makes sense, since wine quality is a subjective taster's judgment shaped by more factors than alcohol, volatile acidity, and sulphates alone.*
*A model with more features or a non-linear algorithm would likely do meaningfully better.*

---

## Pandas vs Polars Benchmark

The last step of `analysis_polars.py` file, is a small speed test: it picks four
everyday operations already used elsewhere in this project (reading the CSV,
previewing rows, filtering, grouping) and times how long each one takes in
Pandas versus Polars. Each operation is run 20 times and only the fastest run
is kept, since a single run can be thrown off by things like a slow disk read
or Python still warming up.

```python
benchmark_results["pandas"]["CSV Read"] = best_of(lambda: pd.read_csv("data/wine_quality_merged.csv"))
benchmark_results["polars"]["CSV Read"] = best_of(lambda: pl.read_csv("data/wine_quality_merged.csv"))
```

**Findings:**

*Polars reads the CSV about 3x faster than Pandas (0.00058s vs 0.00174s), which matches Polars' reputation for a faster, multithreaded, Rust-based CSV parser.*
*But for `.head()`, filtering, and the groupby, Pandas is as fast or faster than Polars. This is the opposite of what "Polars is faster" would predict, and it comes down to dataset size: the wine dataset has only 6,497 rows. Polars is built around a query-planning and multithreading engine that carries fixed per-call overhead, which pays off on large datasets by parallelizing work across cores, but on a dataset this small that overhead outweighs the actual computation, which Pandas can just do directly in a single tight loop.*
*In short: for a dataset this size, the choice between Pandas and Polars barely matters for speed. Polars' advantage should grow as the dataset grows into the millions of rows, since that's where its parallel, lazy-evaluation engine starts to amortize its overhead, but that's not something this ~6,500-row dataset can demonstrate.*

Run the benchmark (it's the last step of the script):

```bash
python analysis_polars.py
```

## Model Limitations and Future Directions

- **Only 3 of the 11 available chemical features were used, capping R² at 0.253.** 

Alcohol, volatile acidity, and sulphates explain just a quarter of the variance in quality. Training on the full feature set, or a non-linear algorithm would likely capture more of the signal the linear model is currently missing.

- **The 1,177 duplicate rows identified in Step 2 were never removed before training.** 

Since the train/test split was done on the full dataset, repeated rows could land in both sets, letting the model partly "memorize" wines instead of generalizing. Deduplicating before the split would give a more honest estimate of real-world performance.

- **Quality was modeled as a continuous number, but it's really an ordinal score from 3-9 assigned by human tasters.** 

Linear regression can predict values like 5.4 that don't correspond to any real score, and treats a 1-point miss the same everywhere on the scale. An ordinal regression or classification approach would match the actual structure of the target variable more closely.
